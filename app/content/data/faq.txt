{"q":"What is Anime-flix?","a":"Anime-flix is an anime streaming site that automatically tracks your progress on <a href='http://myanimelist.net/' target='_blank'>MyAnimeList</a>."},
{"q":"Is Anime-flix affiliated with MyAnimeList?","a":"No, Anime-flix has no affiliation with MyAnimeList. We simply use MyAnimeList to track progress and provide information about anime (ie. descriptions, start/end dates, cover pictures, etc.)"},
{"q":"Does Anime-flix store any content retrieved from MyAnimeList?","a":"No, all content from MyAnimeList is retrieved on an instance by instance basis. Some of which is forgotten after use, but all of it is forgotten after the session is closed. All credit for MyAnimeList content goes to MyAnimeList and those whom the give credit to."},
{"q":"Does Anime-flix store MyAnimeList login information?","a":"No, your login information is remembered by your browser only, if you unchecked remember me, it is forgotten at the end of your session."},
{"q":"Do you host the video content displayed on Anime-flix?","a":"No, all video content is hosted on third part servers with no connection to Anime-flix. The content is streamed from the third party servers to the end user."},
{"q":"What do you claim to own?","a":"I own Anime-flix. Anime-flix works by having your browser gather content from many sources and display it to you. I do not claim to own any content collected from other sources."},
{"q":"I am using Firefox, why do weird things happen like an episode restarting when I stop watching?","a":"This is because people who write browsers are ego maniacs and think that they are too good for standers, as a result all browsers work slightly differently. Firefox for instance, seems to dislike having a bogus source in its video tags (the way I stop the video). When it is handed a bogus source, it decides to just start playing the last thing that worked again. Long story short, Anime-flix targets Google Chrome, I am working on fixing cross browser issues but there are many special cases that have to accounted for so it is neither an easy task nor a quick one."},
{"q":"I am using Internet Explorer, why doesn't Anime-flix seem to work at all?","a":"Microsoft makes really good development tools, they do not make good web browsers. I believe in freedom of choice so do as you will... but you should probably chose a different browser."}
